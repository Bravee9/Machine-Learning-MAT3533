# Week 3: Linear Regression

## Algorithm

Linear regression for continuous variable prediction. Implements ordinary least squares (OLS) method for finding the best-fitting linear relationship between features and target variables.

## Datasets

### 1. SAT-GPA Prediction
- 86 student records
- Feature: SAT scores
- Target: GPA (Grade Point Average)
- Simple linear regression example

### 2. Fuel Consumption
- Vehicle fuel efficiency data
- Multiple vehicle characteristics
- Target: Fuel consumption rate

### 3. Additional Examples
- Various regression scenarios
- Multiple feature datasets

Files:
- `SAT_GPA - SAT_GPA.csv`
- `fuel.txt`
- `vidu3_lin_reg.txt`
- `vidu4_lin_reg.txt`

## Implementation

### Key Concepts
- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
- Cost function minimization
- Gradient descent
- Model evaluation metrics (R², MSE, RMSE)

### Methods
- Simple linear regression (single feature)
- Multiple linear regression
- Manual implementation and scikit-learn
- Residual analysis

## Results

- Regression coefficients interpretation
- Goodness of fit (R² scores)
- Prediction accuracy
- Residual plots and diagnostics

## Usage

```python
jupyter notebook linear_regression.ipynb
```

## Key Learnings

- Linear relationship modeling
- Assumptions of linear regression
- Outlier impact on model performance
